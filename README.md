## statement

ScalaCollider is a [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sf.net) client for the Scala programming language. It is (C)opyright 2008&ndash;2015 by Hanns Holger Rutz. All rights reserved. ScalaCollider is released under the [GNU General Public License](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider/blob/master/LICENSE) and comes with absolutely no warranties. To contact the author, send an email to `contact at sciss.de`

SuperCollider is one of the most elaborate open source sound synthesis frameworks. It comes with its own language 'SCLang' that controls the sound synthesis processes on a server, 'scsynth'. ScalaCollider is an alternative to 'SCLang', giving you the (perhaps) familiar Scala language to express these sound synthesis processes, and letting you hook up any other Scala, Java or JVM-based libraries. ScalaCollider's function is more reduced than 'SCLang', focusing on UGen graphs and server-side resources such as buses and buffers. Other functionality is part of the standard Scala library, e.g. collections and GUI. Other functionality, such as plotting, MIDI, client-side sequencing (Pdefs, Routines, etc.) must be added through dedicated libraries (see section 'packages' below).

While ScalaCollider itself is in the form of a _library_ (although you can use it from the REPL with `sbt console`), you may want to have a look at the [ScalaCollider-Swing](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing) project that adds an easy-to-use standalone application or mini-IDE. On the ScalaCollider-Swing page, you'll find a link to download a readily compiled binary for this standalone version.

A still experimental system on top of ScalaCollider, providing higher level abstractions, is [SoundProcesses](http://github.com/Sciss/SoundProcesses) and its graphical front-end [Mellite](http://github.com/Sciss/Mellite). Please get in touch if you intend to use these, as the documentation is still sparse, and the system and API is still a moving target.

## download and resources

The current version of ScalaCollider (the library) can be downloaded from [github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider).

More information is available from the wiki at [github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider/wiki](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider/wiki). The API documentation is available at [sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider/latest/api](http://sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider/latest/api/).

The best way to ask questions, no matter if newbie or expert, is to use the mailing list at [groups.google.com/group/scalacollider](http://groups.google.com/group/scalacollider). To subscribe, simply send a mail to `ScalaCollider+subscribe@googlegroups.com` (you will receive a mail asking for confirmation).

The early architectural design of ScalaCollider is documented in the SuperCollider 2010 symposium proceedings: [H.H.Rutz, Rethinking the SuperCollider Client...](http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/Rutz_SuperCollider2010.pdf). However, many design decisions have been revised or refined in the meantime.

The file [ExampleCmd.sc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider/master/ExampleCmd.sc) is a good starting point for understanding how UGen graphs are written in ScalaCollider. You can directly copy and paste these examples into the ScalaCollider-Swing application's interpreter window.

See the section 'starting a SuperCollider server' below, for another simple example of running a server (possibly from your own application code).

## building

ScalaCollider currently builds with sbt 0.13 against Scala 2.11, 2.10. It requires SuperCollider 3.5 or higher. Note that the UGens are provided by the separate [ScalaColliderUGens](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderUGens) project. A simple Swing front end is provided by the [ScalaColliderSwing](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing) project.

Targets for sbt:

* `clean` &ndash; removes previous build artefacts
* `compile` &ndash; compiles classes into target/scala-version/classes
* `doc` &ndash; generates api in target/scala-version/api/index.html
* `package` &ndash; packages jar in target/scala-version
* `console` &ndash; opens a Scala REPL with ScalaCollider on the classpath

__Note__: Due to [SI-7436](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7436), the project must be currently compiled against Scala 2.10.0 and not 2.10.1 through 2.10.4. It can be used, however, with any Scala 2.10 version.

## linking

To use this project as a library, use the following artifact:

    libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" %% "scalacollider" % v

The current version `v` is `"1.17.1"`

## starting a SuperCollider server

The following short example illustrates how a server can be launched and a synth played:

```scala
import de.sciss.synth._
import ugen._
import Ops._

val cfg = Server.Config()
cfg.program = "/path/to/scsynth"
// runs a server and executes the function
// when the server is booted, with the
// server as its argument 
Server.run(cfg) { s =>
  // play is imported from package de.sciss.synth.
  // it provides a convenience method for wrapping
  // a synth graph function in an `Out` element
  // and playing it back.
  play {
    val f = LFSaw.kr(0.4).madd(24, LFSaw.kr(Seq(8, 7.23)).madd(3, 80)).midicps
    CombN.ar(SinOsc.ar(f) * 0.04, 0.2, 0.2, 4)
  }
}    
```

### Specifying SC_HOME

__Note__: This section is mostly irrelevant on Linux, where `scsynth` is normally found on `$PATH`, and thus no further customisation is needed.

You might omit to set the `program` of the server's configuration, as ScalaCollider will by default read the system property `SC_HOME`, and if that is not set, the environment variable `SC_HOME`. Environment variables are stored depending on your operating system. On OS X, if you use the app-bundle of ScalaCollider-Swing, you can access them from the terminal:

    $ mkdir ~/.MacOSX
    $ touch ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
    $ open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

Here, `open` should launch the PropertyEditor. Otherwise you can edit this file using a text editor. The content will be like this:

    {
      "SC_HOME" = "/Applications/SuperCollider_3.6.5/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/";
    }

On the other hand, if you run ScalaCollider from a Bash terminal, you edit `~/.bash_profile` instead. The entry is something like:

    export SC_HOME=/path/to/folder-of-scsynth

On linux, the environment variables probably go in `~/.profile`.

For more sound examples, see `ExampleCmd.sc`. There is also an introductory video for the [Swing frontend](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing) at [www.screencast.com/t/YjUwNDZjMT](http://www.screencast.com/t/YjUwNDZjMT).

## packages

ScalaCollider's core functionality may be extended by other libraries I or other people wrote. The following two libraries are dependencies and therefore always available in ScalaCollider:

- Audio file functionality is provided by the [ScalaAudioFile](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaAudioFile) library.
- Open Sound Control functionality is provided by the [ScalaOSC](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC) library.

Here are some examples for libraries not included:

- MIDI functionality is not included, but can be added with the [ScalaMIDI](http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaMIDI) library.
- Plotting is most easily achieved through [Scala-Chart](https://github.com/wookietreiber/scala-chart), which is conveniently included in ScalaCollider-Swing.

## projects using ScalaCollider

Please let me know if you are developing an interesting project that involves ScalaCollider, and I am happy to add a link to it here.
