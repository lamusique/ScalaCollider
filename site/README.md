# ScalaCollider Site Generation

This directory contains a small project which can generate the [ScalaCollider GitHub page](http://sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider). Currently this consists merely of the API docs, which will be published to [sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider/latest/api](http://sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider/latest/api).

It can also be used to build a local copy of the API docs. Other than the main project doc task, this uses [sbt-unidoc](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-unidoc) to produce combined API docs for ScalaOSC, ScalaAudioFile, ScalaCollider-UGens and ScalaCollider.

In order for this to work, it pulls in these libraries directly by closing their respective GitHub repositories and building them from source. For them to stay in sync, we use git version tags. For example in `build.sbt`, you can see that the URL for ScalaOSC is `"git://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC.git#v1.1.2"`. Therefore, when building the unified docs, that repository is internally cloned by sbt, using the particular tag `v1.1.2`.

__To build the docs locally, run `sbt unidoc`. You can view the results via `open target/scala-2.10/unidoc/index.html`.__

Alternatively, you can run the site via a local web server as `sbt preview-site` which is a functionality of the [sbt-site](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site) plugin. I publish the results to GitHub using `sbt ghpages-push-site` which is provided by the [sbt-ghpages](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages) plugin.
